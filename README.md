# Udacity Front-end Nonodegree - Project 2
## Interactive Resume

This project is the second project of the Udacity Front-end Nonodegree Program. It is a simple one page interactive resume featuring a Google Map of the places I have lived, went to school, and worked. 

This project was built using a javascript helper to layout the structure of the page.
